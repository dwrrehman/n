            the solution which i found is:
                

                        simply interpret the expression list as a block whos type is the type of the last expression. 
                            
                                for type inference and checking, we need to use the last expression int he list.
                                    

                                        
                     the part we are implementing now, is to make the csr function have two parts:
                        
                            1. csr_single(): parsesa  single expression.

                            2. csr(): parses a series of expressions, using the last one as the type of the whole set. 
                                


                      we realized that the traverse, and the resolve frontends both take expression lists, and operate on them eclusively, basically.
                            


                      finally, we figured out that we need to:      (eventually)
                        

                            1. make a huge change to the typr inference system within csr, 
                                whichis that we need the idea of:     "gradual type-set resolution."

                                        which is simply the idea that we gradually resolve which types a symbol can be, (based on literals, etc....)

                                            as we find it in use of another function, as we continue to parse. 

                                                

                                                we only errror if we find that a given variable was found to have a non singleton type-set (the set of types which are consisntent withthe code.)

                                                    
                                                        
                                                        (however, if the code uses numeric literals, then we will simply pick the word size (assumign its wide enough) to choose a type for numeric literals. )












    1909091.15:
    - we are still working through how to put subexpressions back into csr.

    - we have esssentially decided to make the grammar binary recursive, instead of ternary recursive.
    - - we are going to have blocks of code be delimited by newlines--- tabs are significant only to determine newlines, essentially... i think.

        - definitely want the language be able to use the indentation as the syntactic form. 

            thats really important.
