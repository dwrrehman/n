the current status of the compiler is:

    
    - we are still working through how to put subexpressions back into csr.

    - we have esssentially decided to make the grammar binary recursive, instead of ternary recursive.
    - - we are going to have blocks of code be delimited by newlines--- tabs are significant only to determine newlines, essentially... i think.

        - definitely want the language be able to use the indentation as the syntactic form. 

            thats really important.
