if we define a function which is generic for [T], 
	and we call a function called "printf", 

	which must take a concept, 

	the compiler will figure out that the "T" type, must be a specific type of generic.

	and thus the compiler will TYPE INFER  the function as not a general genric, but as a specifc kind of generic specified by printf. (else there could be an error!)
