we need to define a set of function signatures that you cant define, and these are non-negotiable, because the parser (and you) literally could never tell the difference:



(if something block: {})    :: and its else variants.

(while something block: {}) 

(repeat block: {} while something)

(for something in soemthing block: {})

(using something)
