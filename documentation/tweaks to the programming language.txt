(parse string using delimiter) {
    use delimiter      ;; this acts as a full in statement, and a usage staemnet, to keep delimiter as not part of the signature.

}



(main) {

    s = "hello world"

    parse

}




;; note: you can make all identifiers in a signature be a keyword or symbol, except for the function parameters.

;; we should be making the keyword "using" actually be a function, (or at least have function call syntax. its not a statement, its a function call.)

now, should we allow the user to pass in a block of code?





yes i think thats useful.




specfically, we should make the for loop actually accept a block of code as one of its parameters.


for i in range {
    ;; code
}


;; eh, i dont know about this.

i think that we should allow the user to define these with similar style syntax themselves, but not neccessarilymake the for a actual function. because that sorta riducolous.

note,


also, we really need to redo the comments syntax, do be more clean.


possibly be more general...?

ease of typing is not really an issue.
