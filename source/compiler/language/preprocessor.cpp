 so, to really wring this out,


 1. first, we must find a macro signature "::{"
 2. next, we must parse everything up until we find a











 and then, we realized, we are working at the wrong level of abstraction.












 what we really need, is to build "::{", ":::", and "::}" into the grammar of our language.
 ie, this should be a ebnf statement, which contains translation units:

 metaprogram
 = ::{ translationunit ::: translationunit ::}

 and then a translationunit is a list of expressions, or metapograms, at the top level. (a metaprogram can only appear at the top level, because its not actually an expression.












 ie, we do not have a preprocessor in our language. we just dont. we dont need one.



 we simply have a recursive compiler!







 we will call the frontend() function, right before parsing.
 we are actually going to write a seperate parser, which makes
 a copy of the file, and then simply parses for all the macros
 in it, ignoring the rest. it then simply keeps a datastructure
 which is called "macro" which will have two strings,
 the pattern n code, and the body n code.

 we then, in trying to parse the given file,

 will first simply parse the macro.pattern_n_code, using the FRONTEND(),
 then execute the resulting llvm ir, and see what the resultant pattern string is.

 then, we will simply parse the macro.body_n_code, using the FRONTEND(),
 then execute the resultign llvm ir, and see what the resultant body string is.





 and so we need:

 struct macro {
 std::string pattern = "";
 std::string body = "";
 };


 or, in n3zqx2l

 (macro)
 _ pattern = ""
 _ body = ""















 our semantic analyzer is the one which will actually detect a metaprogram in our language,
