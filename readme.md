# n3zqx2l

### Created By Daniel Rehman.

n3zqx2l is a general-purpose, imperative and procedural, efficient, strongly, statically, and nominally typed, statically scoped, type-infered, compiled and JIT-compiled systems programming language, designed with simplicity, minimalism, readability, and runtime performance in mind, and is built using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

This project is an implementation of a n3zqx2l compiler, called "n". It is written in C, and uses the LLVM C API.


### Finally, heres the hello world program in n3zqx2l:

```
  print hello, world!
```

...nothing more or less than what a hello world program should be.
