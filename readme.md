# A Programming Language Created By Daniel Rehman.

this is a programming language. its pretty awesome.


### hello world program:

~~~~
(main) {
    using .io
    print "Hello, world!"
}
~~~~


Its designed for readability (like python), while still being as fast as C or C++.
It uses a new function syntax i made.

# n3zqx2l

### Created By Daniel Rehman.

n3zqx2l is a general-purpose, minimalist, multi-paradigm, efficient, extensible, strongly, statically, and nominally typed, statically scoped, aggressively type-infered, expression-based, compiled, JIT-compiled, and interpreted programming language, designed with code readability and runtime performance in mind, and built using the LLVM compiler infrastrcture.

This project is an implementation of a n3zqx2l compiler, called "nostril". It is written in C++, and uses the LLVM C++ API.


### finally, heres the hello world program:

```
  print "hello, world!"
```

...nothing more or less than what a hello world program should be.
>>>>>>> develop
