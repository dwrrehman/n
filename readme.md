# n
 _The language with no syntax._
 Created By Daniel Rehman.

_n_ is a general-purpose, low-level, imperative and procedural, strongly, statically, nominally, and dependently typed, statically scoped, type-infered, compile-time interpreted and compiled systems programming language, designed with simplicity, minimalism, readability, and runtime performance in mind, and is built using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

This project is an implementation of a n compiler. It is written in C, and uses the LLVM C API.
