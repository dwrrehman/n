# n3zqx2l

### Created By Daniel Rehman.

n3zqx2l is a general-purpose, minimalist, imperative, procedural, efficient, strongly, statically, and nominally typed, statically scoped, type-infered, expression-based, compiled, JIT-compiled, and interpreted systems programming language, designed with minimalism, code readability, and runtime performance in mind, and built using the LLVM compiler infrastrcture.

This project is an implementation of a n3zqx2l compiler, called "n". It is written in C++, and uses the LLVM C++ API.


### finally, heres the hello world program:

```
  print "hello, world!"
```

...nothing more or less than what a hello world program should be.
