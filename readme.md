# n3zqx2l

### Created By Daniel Rehman.

    EASIER THAN PYTHON
    SIMPLER THAN SCHEME
    FASTER THAN C

n3zqx2l is a general-purpose, imperative and procedural, efficient and low-level, strongly, statically, nominally, and dependently typed, statically scoped, type-infered, compile-time interpreted and compiled systems programming language, designed with simplicity, minimalism, readability, and runtime performance in mind, and is built using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

This project is an implementation of a n3zqx2l compiler, called "n". It is written in C, and uses the LLVM C API.


### Finally, heres the hello world program in n3zqx2l:

```
  print hello, world!
```

...nothing more or less than what a hello world program should be.
